# Springboot REST Service App for Rancher Deployment

LOREM IPSUM is a lightweight, reliable and easy to use distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. Once deployed, users can leverage persistent volumes provided by LOREM IPSUM.

LOREM IPSUM creates a dedicated storage controller for each volume and synchronously replicates the volume across multiple replicas stored on multiple nodes. The storage controller and replicas are themselves orchestrated using Kubernetes. LOREM IPSUM supports snapshots, backups and even allows you to schedule recurring snapshots and backups!

**Important**: Please install LOREM IPSUM chart in `LOREM IPSUM-system` namespace only.

**Warning**: LOREM IPSUM doesn't support downgrading from a higher version to a lower version.
